Book Followed - Game Theory 101: The complete Book - William Spaniel

What is Game Theory?
The Study of strategically interdependent behavior. Strategic interdependence - what I do affects your outcomes and what you do affects my outcomes. Not just about winning and losing (though it could be).

1. The logic of strategically interdependent situations gets extremely complicated extremely fast. Game theory gives us "accounting" tools. 
2. Game theory allows us to quicly draw parallels from one situation to another. This will allow you to think on your feet much better than you can today. 

Chapter 1: The Basics
Simultaneous move games. Examples: Soccer penalty kicks, prison interrogation, deciding wether to stop or drive at a spotlight. 
Items Covered: strict dominance, iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies, pure strategy Nash equilibrium, best responses, mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, weak dominance

Chaper 2: Extensive Form Games
Games where players take turns moving. Examples: war, invasion plans, police searches. 
Items Covered: backward induction, subgame perfect equilibrium, credible threats, tying hands, commitment problems, forward induction. 

Chapter 3: Advanced Strategic Form Games
Generalized. Example: Does a striker kick left more frequently as his accuracy improves on the left side? Items covered: comparative statics, knife-edge equilibria, and symmetric, zero-sum games.
