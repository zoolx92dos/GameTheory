Book Followed - Game Theory 101: The complete Book - William Spaniel

What is Game Theory?
The Study of strategically interdependent behavior. Strategic interdependence - what I do affects your outcomes and what you do affects my outcomes. Not just about winning and losing (though it could be).

1. The logic of strategically interdependent situations gets extremely complicated extremely fast. Game theory gives us "accounting" tools. 
2. Game theory allows us to quicly draw parallels from one situation to another. This will allow you to think on your feet much better than you can today. 

Chapter 1: The Basics
Simultaneous move games. Examples: Soccer penalty kicks, prison interrogation, deciding wether to stop or drive at a spotlight. 
Items Covered: strict dominance, iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies, pure strategy Nash equilibrium, best responses, mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, weak dominance

Chaper 2: Extensive Form Games
Games where players take turns moving. Examples: war, invasion plans, police searches. 
Items Covered: backward induction, subgame perfect equilibrium, credible threats, tying hands, commitment problems, forward induction. 

Chapter 3: Advanced Strategic Form Games
Generalized. Example: Does a striker kick left more frequently as his accuracy improves on the left side? Items covered: comparative statics, knife-edge equilibria, and symmetric, zero-sum games. 


Prisoner's Dilemma and Strict Dominance
________________________________________

The situation
Two suspects are arrested. 
The police thinks that they were trying to rob a store. But the cops can only prove that the suspects were trespassing. 
Thus, the police need one of the criminals to rat out the other. 

The Potential Deal
If no one confesses to roberry, the police can only charge the prisoners for trespassing. Punishment: 1 month in jail each. 
If one confesses and the other doesn't, the police will be lenient on the rat and severely punish the quiet one. Punishment: 12 months in jail for the quiet one; 0 months for the rat. 
If both confesses, the police punishes both of them equally. Punishment: 8 months in jail each. 

The question
Suppose the thieves only want to minimize the number of months they spend in jail. Should they confess to the police?

Prisoner's Dilemma

                                    Player 2

                          Keep Quiet        Confess

         Keep Quiet        -1, -1           -12, 0

Player 1    
          Confess          0, -12            -8, -8


Strict Dominance
Strategy x strictly dominates strategy y for a player if x generated a greater payoff than y regardless of what the other players do. 
Rational players never play strictly dominated strategies. Why play y when you can play x instead ?

Prisoner's Dilemma

                                    Player 2

                          Keep Quiet        Confess

         Keep Quiet        -1, -1           -12, 0

Player 1    
          Confess          0, -12            -8, -8

Both confess - the strategy

The other player might change the strategy. 

IEDS Game

                                    Player 2
                        Left       Center       Right
              Up        13,3        1,4          7,3
Player 1    Middle       4,1        3,3          6,2
             Down       -1,9        2,8          8,-1


Iterated Elimination of Strictly Dominated Strategies (IESDS)If you ever see a strictly dominated strategy, eliminate it immediately. Order does not matter. 
If IESDS leads to a single outcome whether you eliminate strategy #1 or strategy #2 first.
